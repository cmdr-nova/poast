# POAST
A workflow that works alongside <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities" target="_blank">Deploy to Neocities</a> (although, you can remove this) to also push a new post to Mastodon. This is something I spent ... a very long time working on. There was a time when I stayed up until 2am, go myself 3 hours of sleep, went to work, came home, and then stayed up until 2am again finishing the initial version of Poast. Now, with some tweaks, and more tweaks, and a few more tweaks, it works, seamlessly, and without issue.

Welcome, to the POAST.
